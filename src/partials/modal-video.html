                    <p>The factory can handle up to 100 tons of milk. The whole milk brought from the farms is first delivered to the milk
                    dispenser, from where it is sent to the laboratory for control. If the milk is all right, it will be pasteurized and
                    then it will be stored in a giant tank or immediately put into production.</p>

                    The fatness of the milk may vary at the time
                    of acceptance, in fact it is an optional criterion in the production of ice cream. It is important that the finished
                    filling has a fat value of 12% - that is the requirement. To get this percentage of fat, the normalized milk is combined
                    with condensed and cream. And if the milk analyzer tests show that the mixture does not reach the required fat, you can
                    add some butter to the future filling.
